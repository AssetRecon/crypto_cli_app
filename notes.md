1.Plan your gem, imagine your interface
	a. User enters Cryptocurrency token (XLM) (or pokemon location)
	b. Shows list of current exchanges the token is being traded on (or list of nearby pokemon)
		i.Binance
		ii.bittrex
	c. user can drill down on particular exchange to get current trading price and more details (users can drill down on the pokemon's location)
2. Start with project structure - google.
	bundle gem "gem_name" will create project structure
